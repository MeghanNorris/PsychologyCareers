# PsychologyCareers

This original source file was created by Meghan E. Norris and Tyson W. Baker at Queen's University. This spreadsheet contains data regarding careers related to psychology, sourced from the Government of Canada's job bank in the Summer of 2018.

For ease of use, we have grouped careers under the following headings: Business; Legal; Medical; Mental Health/Helping Professions; Research. Of course the jobs that are available to those with training in psychology are much more diverse than this list. It is hoped that the book associated with this resource will help to highlight more of those many paths. The book will be freely accessible at the following link in Fall of 2019: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/psychologycareers/

NOC is the abbreviation for "National Occupational Classification." NOC codes allow for standardization and comparison across job classifications within Canada. NOCs contain many job titles, so some job titles in this document list only the official title of the NOC.  In that case, search for the NOC or official title to find more details.

In other cases where cells are blank, data was unavailable at the time of sourcing.

The most up-to-date data, and newly emerging career search tools, can be found from the Government of Canada's Job Bank, located here: https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/trend-analysis  

We are sharing this resource on GitHub, a community known for positive collaboration. It is hoped that users will create new versions of this spreadsheet, helping to crowdsource even more examples of concrete careers available to those with training in psychology.
