# PsychologyCareers

This original source file was created by Meghan E. Norris and Tyson W. Baker at Queen's University. This spreadsheet contains data regarding careers related to psychology, sourced from the Government of Canada's job bank in the Summer of 2018.

For some job titles, the row will contain no data except for an NOC code. Please use that NOC code to refer back to an earlier section (i.e., that job title falls under an alternative category).

In other cases where cells are blank, data was unavailable at the time of sourcing.
